-- "Case" signals what the attached word's function is in the phrase
-- The morpho-syntactic cases signal which verb argument they are
-- Genitive cases signal that a noun is modifying another noun
--   * Inalienable Possessive, Alienable Possessive, Possesed, Partitive
-- Prepositional case signals a relationship between a adposition and noun
--   * English's Oblique case is a merger Accusative and Prepositional, I think
--   * I suppose you would have either Prepostional case + actual prepositions OR a bunch of Location/Motion-related cases
--   * Although maybe both could work, and you would know which prepositions go with which NPs
-- Locative (at), Seperative (away), and Lative (to) cases
--   * These type of cases are really granular
--   * Do these represent VP-NP or VP-NP-NP relations?
--   * I suppose you'd have pairs of these working (Like Seperative and Lative) to show motion away from something to something else

-- General cases:
-- Morphosyntactic cases (NP-VP) showing theta roles
-- Genitive (NP-NP cases) showing relations
-- Seperative, Locative, Lative (VP-NP cases) showing a motion relative to a thing
-- Prepositional (PP-NP cases) showing that the noun is what the preposition is talking about
-- Partitive? (DP-NP case?)
